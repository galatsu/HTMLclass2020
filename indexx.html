<p> Since you must have read all of the material in the first page, hence you're here now... Let's play a little quiz, to test what you've understood! If it's correct, good job! :) If it's not... I'll feel sad. :( </p>
  <br></br>
<h2> Which of the following statements is correct? </h2>
<button type="button" onclick="document.write('Correct!')">Ponyo is a character in Ponyo.</button>
<button type="button" onclick="document.write('Incorrect!')">Spirited Away came out a couple years ago.</button>

<br></br>

<p> Thank you again for reading! Have a cute picture in case you got the question right! </p>
